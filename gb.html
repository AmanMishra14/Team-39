<h1 align=center>GARBAGE PROBLEM IN OUR COUNTRY</H1>
<hr>
<h3>
In olden times, garbage generally comprised only organic waste which went into the ground, but the proportion of chemicals in the waste is increasing with the hectic pace of modern development. In countries like India, things used earlier as bags were not harmful. Earlier the pottery was used for liquid substances, and jute bag was used to carry goods. Now, the plastic has changed the situation and a problem has arisen with it because the plastic never degrades. Its recycling is possible, but there is no proper system to deposit it.

In our country, the cities are getting reduced to dumping grounds of waste. Garbage is present everywhere in some form or the other whether there is a village or a city, a temple or a mosque. This problem has been increasing since the last nearly three decades, leading to health issues and degradation of environment. Today we are victims of many types of waste including domestic, agricultural and industrial waste.  Every year tonnes of waste or garbage are produced in the country, and only one percent of it is recycled. The rest either accumulates in the fields or in the streets and in the end, during the rainy season; it reaches the oceans through rivers.

There are many reasons for the production of garbage. One reason for this is growing urbanization and prosperity. The more financially strong is the country or the city, the more garbage it will produce. It can also be seen by linking poverty and prosperity, competence and inefficiency. This means where the aspiration for the amenities are high in populations, there will also be increase in the amount of waste. Today, China and India are the prominent examples of this in the world. Both are taking strides in economic development, but in the process, they are also producing piles of garbage. Other reasons for this include changing lifestyle, lack of waste-management and options, and also the big question of the ethics that is fast eroding. We assume that it is our compulsion to produce garbage and its disposal is the work of the government. Perhaps this is where we are making the biggest mistake.
